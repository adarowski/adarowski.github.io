Last year, I made it to SABR43 in Philadelphia—but only for one day so I could [present my poster on the Hall of Stats](http://www.hallofstats.com/articles/hall-of-stats-poster-at-sabr-43). This year, I wasn't able to make it because I was in the process of moving to New Hampshire.

I did send some work, though. I put together the bio for the 2014 SABR Overlooked Base Ball Legend ([Doc Adams](http://www.hallofstats.com/articles/doc-adams-overlooked-legend)). I also wrote a submission for *The National Pastime*—the [Houston Astros Hall of Stats](http://www.hallofstats.com/articles/the-houston-astros-hall-of-stats).

Still, I was bummed to miss the conference. I was even more bummed when I found out I won an award.

Peter Mancuso, chair of the Nineteenth Century Committee, gave me the "Chairman's Award" for my "duties as the new Chairman of the Overlooked 19th Century Baseball Legends Project Committee, and for managing an extremely professional election process."


Yesterday, my award arrived—an inscribed replica 1880s Burlingame model bat produced by the Phoenix Bat Company. I want to thank Peter for the honor and the entire Overlooked Legends committee for such a smooth and exciting election this year. The bat will go perfectly in my brand new office!
