First, when I think of the term "web designer" I think of a couple different camps—the traditional web designer who works on "static" websites and the product designer who works on web applications. By "static" websites, I mean content-based websites that aim to market a company's products or services.

A traditional web designer likely works directly with marketing (if they are an in-house designer) or a client (if they work with an agency). They could also work with a web developer who would implement their design and integrate with a content management system (unless the designer is comfortable doing that work).

A product designer is a web designer who has a very specific set of skills. Product designers work with font end developers, back end developers, product managers, product marketers, and—most importantly—users. A product designer's skill set doesn't lean as much toward pure visual design (though that's always a great skill to have), instead focusing on user experience design, interaction design, and usability (these terms overlap a great deal).

A traditional web designer has more of a marketing role. They want to show you the benefits of a product or service so that you'll use it. The product designer works on the product the traditional web designer is essentially trying to sell.

At HubSpot, we have one team who works on [HubSpot.com](http://hubspot.com) and a completely different team in a completely different division that builds the product. I work on the product. When I worked with BatchBook a few years ago, we were a very small team. I worked on both the company site and the product. I can handle both , but I'm definitely much more of a product designer.

"Web developer" is a very general term that I take to mean something similar to a front end developer (which we'll go into more in a bit) or "the person to does everything except the design."
