On January 5, I released a three-song EP called *Existential Crisis Songs*.

## A little background

From 1996 until 2000, I was in a band called Ego Booster. We were a three-piece band (I played guitar and sang). In 1998, the drummer and I (the bass player had departed) recorded a full length CD. After Ego Booster disbanded, I played bass in a friend’s band (Bi Janus) for a while before recording some demos on my own.

Then, shortly before the birth of my first child in 2004, I recorded one last song. It would be my last song for a decade…

## It’s good to be back

Over the last couple years, I’ve been watching the calendar. I didn’t want a decade to lapse before recording something new. In late July, I dusted off GarageBand and my old Les Paul *(seen on the album artwork)*, borrowed a Rocksmith guitar cable from [Jeffrey Chupp](http://semanticart.com) and a bass from [Michael Berkowitz](http://songsaboutsnow.com/), and broke ground on a new track called [“All My Axes Are Exes”](https://adarowski.bandcamp.com/track/all-my-axes-are-exes-2). On September 2, 2014 I released it to the world on Bandcamp and received just enough positive feedback to keep going. [“Mountain”](https://adarowski.bandcamp.com/track/mountain-2) followed in late October and [“Breakdown”](https://adarowski.bandcamp.com/track/breakdown) was finished in December and released with the EP.

## What’s next?

I’m not sure yet. I’d like to keep going. Will another EP follow? Will these three songs eventually make it on a full-length album? We’ll see. Thanks for listening.

## Update

I opted to go the full-length route. My new album *YAY!* comes out on November 2. You can pre-order it on [Bandcamp](https://adarowski.bandcamp.com/album/yay).
