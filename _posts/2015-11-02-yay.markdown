## A little background

In January of 2015, I [released](/existential-crisis-songs/) a 3-song EP called [*Existential Crisis Songs*](https://adarowski.bandcamp.com/album/existential-crisis-songs). It was a big deal for me—I hadn’t recorded any music in almost a decade. Inspired by new surroundings (we moved to New Hampshire a month before I started writing “All My Axes Are Exes”) and new influences (this album was heavily inflenced by [Beach Slang](https://beachslang.bandcamp.com/), [Iron Chic](https://ironchic.bandcamp.com/), and [Mike Krol](https://mikekrol.bandcamp.com/)—all new discoveries in 2014), I set my goals and hit them. First, a song. Then, an EP. Finally, an album.

## So now what?

A decade-long lack of music is gone. What about the fact that it’s been over fifteen years since I played my own music on a stage? Some people have shown interest in playing with me. But starting a band and playing out? I don’t know if I can fit that in my life right now.

For now, I’ll keep writing. Watch out for album number two.
