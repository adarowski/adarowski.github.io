In the Fall of 1991, I was at my friend Ben Kimball’s house. He said, “Hey—listen to this.” It was a song he had taped off the radio. The song, of course, was Nirvana’s “Smells Like Teen Spirit.” It changed everything. Suddenly I cared—very, very passionately—about music.

That's where this project begins. I like to track [my favorite albums](/25-favorite-albums-of-2015/) each year and often wonder what those charts would look like if I went back through the years I've been obsessed with music. Sadly, I didn't write a blog post listing my favorite albums each year since 1991, but I do have a [Last.fm account](http://last.fm/user/adarowski) that's been tracking everything I've listened to since 2007.

I took a list of the [albums I’ve listened to the most](http://www.last.fm/user/adarowski/library/albums) and split them into their release years. For each year, I'll list “Album of the Year Contenders” (albums I feel could have been worthy of the honor in any given year) and “Other Exceptional Albums.” Some years may not have an Album of the Year Contender while others will have several. In the cases there are none, I’ll reluctantly choose my Album of the Year from the *merely exceptional* albums.

Only original full-length albums are considered—no live albums, compilations, reissues, or EPs. In the event one of these releases was a big deal to me, I’ll list it under “Other Notable Releases” (as an honorable mention of sorts).

Lastly, I’ll publish this five years at a time (starting with 1991–95 below). I’ll be sure to mention on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/adarowski) when the next few years go up.

## 1991

### Album of the Year Contenders

* **Nirvana** — *Nevermind*

### Other Exceptional Albums

* **Pearl Jam** — *Ten*
* **Teenage Fanclub** — *Bandwagonesque*
* **The Smashing Pumpkins** — *Gish*

Nirvana wasn’t the only band to make a big splash in 1991. Pearl Jam’s *Ten* was a big deal, but to me it lacked both the pop sensibilities of *Nevermind* and the jagged edges of *Vs* (which would be released in 1993 and become my favorite Pearl Jam release).

*Gish* was a harbinger of *Siamese Dream* (also released in 1993… and one of the greatest albums ever recorded), but was tremendous in its own right—despite the fact that I didn’t discover it for a couple more years. *Bandwagonesque* was the most successful album in the U.S. by Teenage Fanclub (one of my all-time favorite bands), but happens to be one of my least favorite releases of theirs.

### 1991 Album of the Year

* **Nirvana** — *Nevermind* <span class="album-note">This album set me on a musical path I’m still following.</span>

## 1992

### Album of the Year Contenders

* **Flop** — *Flop & The Fall Of The Mopsqueezer*
* **The Lemonheads** — *It’s a Shame About Ray*

### Other Exceptional Albums

* **Gin Blossoms** — *New Miserable Experience*

Nirvana shook my music world in 1991, but it took a little while for everyone to catch up. The first concert I ever went to involved the two Album of the Year contenders, with Seattle-based Flop opening for The Lemonheads at Lupo’s in Providence (although that show was [in 1994](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/alt.music.alternative/nOSzyLeue4U)).

### 1992 Album of the Year

* **Flop** — *Flop & The Fall Of The Mopsqueezer* <span class="album-note">*It’s a Shame About Ray* was a huge deal for me, but to this day I still reach for Flop more. This is a very close call.</span>

## 1993

### Album of the Year Contenders

* **Archers of Loaf** — *Icky Mettle*
* **Nirvana** — *In Utero*
* **The Lemonheads** — *Come on Feel the Lemonheads*
* **The Smashing Pumpkins** — *Siamese Dream*

### Other Exceptional Albums

* **Dig** — *Dig*
* **Pearl Jam** — *Vs.*
* **Radiohead** — *Pablo Honey*
* **Teenage Fanclub** — *Thirteen*
* **The Breeders** — *Last Splash*
* **The Juliana Hatfield Three** — *Become What You Are*
* **The Posies** — *Frosting On The Beater*

What a year this was. It featured the second full-length releases by Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Smashing Pumpkins—and honestly, each exceeds the first (I even find myself listening to *In Utero* more than *Nevermind* these days). *Come on Feel the Lemonheads* was also a step up for Evan Dando. I didn’t discover *Icky Mettle* until almost 20 years after its release, but I’ve made up for lost time. 

*Dig* and *Pablo Honey* were magnificent debuts while *Last Splash* was a huge breakout. Juliana Hatfield wasn’t with the Lemonheads this time around (she played bass on the *It’s a Shame About Ray* album), but instead released an excellent record of her own. Teenage Fanclub, meanwhile, gave us a solid record that came right before their magnificent peak. This list could have gone on with other excellent releases by Belly, Buffalo Tom, Uncle Tupelo, and Yo La Tengo. A banner year indeed.

### 1993 Album of the Year

* **The Smashing Pumpkins** — *Siamese Dream* <span class="album-note">A tough call with four excellent options. But to me *Siamese Dream* was as good as *Nevermind* was important.</span>

## 1994

### Album of the Year Contenders

* **Weezer** — *Weezer (The Blue Album)*

### Other Exceptional Albums

* **Hole** — *Live Through This*
* **Lush** — *Split*
* **Oasis** — *Definitely Maybe*
* **Pavement** — *Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain*
* **Sunny Day Real Estate** — *Diary*

I vividly remember being at my younger brother’s fifth birthday party at Fantasyland and walking across the street to Sam Goody to pick up *The Blue Album* on cassette. A couple days before, I had heard “Undone” on the radio and scribbled “weezer” on a piece of paper. I kept that piece of paper in the cassette j-card for years.

[I first saw Weezer](http://www.rirocks.net/search/rockpointpalladium.htm) in 1994 (opening for Lush and Live, who both had excellent 1994 albums themselves). 1994 also saw the debut of Oasis, the greatest album by Pavement, Sunny Day Real Estate’s *Diary*, and Hole’s *Live Through This*—a great record I listen to more and more as the years go by.

### Other Notable Releases

* **The Smashing Pumpkins** — *Pisces Iscariot* (Compilation)
* **Radiohead** — *My Iron Lung* (EP)

### 1994 Album of the Year

* **Weezer** — *Weezer (The Blue Album)* <span class="album-note">I don’t think a better album has ever been recorded.</span>

## 1995

### Album of the Year Contenders

* **Radiohead** — *The Bends*
* **Yo La Tengo** — *Electr-o-pura*
* **Teenage Fanclub** — *Grand Prix*
* **Wilco** — *A.M.*

### Other Exceptional Albums

* **Guided by Voices** — *Alien Lanes*
* **Buffalo Tom** — *Sleepy Eyed*
* **Letters to Cleo** — *Wholesale Meats and Fish*
* **For Squirrels** — *Example*
* **Juliana Hatfield** — *Only Everything*
* **The Dambuilders** — *Ruby Red*
* **The Rentals** — *Return of the Rentals*
* **Oasis** — *What's the Story (Morning Glory?)*

This was another incredible year. *The Bends* was a perfect rock record—and I’m still mad at Radiohead for abandoning such a perfect sound. *Electr-o-pura* is probably Yo La Tengo’s greatest record—from a career with many great records. *Grand Prix* is when Teenage Fanclub really hit their stride. *A.M.* is Wilco’s first (and perhaps their greatest).

Beyond that, we had tremendous records by so many bands listed above but also many not on the list (Matthew Sweet, Son Volt, Hum, Archers of Loaf, and Helium—to name just a few).

### Other Notable Releases

* **Teenage Fanclub** — *Teenage Fanclub Have Lost It* (EP)

### 1995 Album of the Year

* **Radiohead** — *The Bends* <span class="album-note">It pains me not to pick *Electr-o-pura*, but *The Bends* was simply perfect. Yo La Tengo is never “perfect”—which is part of their charm.</span>
