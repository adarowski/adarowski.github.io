I’ve always thought of myself as a pretty good youth sports *assistant* coach. Much like my professional life, I have never really strived to be the first in command. But I’ve always been more than willing to get involved however I can. I prefer the supporting role; in this case being a cheerleader on the sidelines for the kids and providing input for the head coach when needed.

I was an assistant coach in baseball for several years until my son fell rather deeply and quickly in love with soccer. It’s not a sport that was on my radar growing up, but as he started playing and following the sport I was quickly hooked. I helped coach in recreational soccer and futsal for a couple years before becoming an assistant for my son’s U10 club travel team for the 2016–17 season.

This past season (Fall 2017), I—for a variety of reasons—suddenly found myself in a head coaching role for the club’s U12 Boys team. The team I took on was something of a hybrid squad. There were four players returning from the previous year’s U12 squad. I brought five talented U10 players with me (including my son) who would step  up to U12. Then I supplemented the roster with five recruits who were new to club soccer — some I knew and some were completely unknown.

I’m a very detail-oriented and analytical person. A huge reason baseball was always such a draw to me was the numbers. I’ve been into baseball statistical analysis since I was ten years old. Even when coaching my son’s baseball teams, I kept <a href="http://darowski.com/nolan/">detailed statistics</a>. I knew that if I was going to run a soccer team, I couldn’t do it like my U10 head coach did. Nothing against him—our minds just work differently. He’s a very laid back person who likes to substitute on the fly based on how the game is going. That’s something I knew I couldn’t do for several reasons:

* While I think that coach did an amazing job, I need to have a plan in place. I can’t really “wing it” with anything.
* I wanted to make sure I allotted relatively equal playing time for all of my players (particularly at the beginning of the season) because I needed get a feel for their skills.
* I wanted to make sure I tried them at many different positions so I could both get a good feel for where they excel and what they enjoy—but also avoid specializing.
* I had a big squad (14 players for 9v9) and I knew that if I didn’t go in with a plan there would be players playing less than half the game. I had a very specific personal goal to ensure every player played at least half of the time (ideally more). If every player showed up and playing time was distributed completely evenly, then each player would play 64% of the time.

First came the math — how could I arrange a 14-player squad into a 60-minute match where each player could get about the same amount of time on the pitch? It turns out this is a much easier problem to solve for a 13-man squad (which is what we ended up having in our first game) so I’ll show that first. Here’s how the 13-man setup works:

The gist:

* 13 players total (marked as P1 through P13 here), but only 12 outfield players at a time.
* 9 positions total, but only 8 outfield positions at a time.
* Split each half into thirds (10 minutes each). That creates 24 outfield “shifts” per half.
* The 12 outfield players then get two shifts each per half. Four play the first two shifts, four play the last two shifts, and four play the first and third shifts while getting a rest in between.
* Repeat (with positional variations) in the second half.
* Worth noting is the two players who play in goal end up picking up an extra shift (2 outfield and 3 in goal).

This worked well in our first game. We played well and even picked up a 4–1 win.

In our second game, we had all 14 players. The math here was a bit more difficult. This is what the lineup ended up looking like:

The gist here:

* 14 players total, but only 13 outfield players at a time.
* 9 positions total, but only 8 outfield positions at a time.
* Split each half into quarters (7½ minutes each). That creates 64 outfield “shifts” per game (not half).
* The players who play goal in each half get two outfield shifts in their other half. That leaves 60 shifts remaining for the 12 non-goalkeepers. They all get five shifts each.

We lost this game… by a lot. Pretty much everything went wrong, but one thing that stood out to me (and some of my players) was that we were substituting far too often. 7 or 8 minute shifts were not long enough to get a feel for the game. Just when a player was starting to get comfortable, I as asking him to come out or move. Not good.

The next time we had all 14 players present for a match, I’d streamlined things quite a bit:

Rather than having a ton of seven minute shifts, I tried to string three shifts in a row (more like 22 minutes) as often as I could. Previously, each position had 4–7 shifts over the course of the game with an average of 5.6 shifts. Now, each position had just four shifts each. The players responded to this system much better. In fact, they won the rest of their regular season games.

Going back to my obsession with baseball stats, planning my shifts allowed me to carefully track where each player was playing, for how long, and how often. If I made my substitutions at a time other than what my match plan said (usually only a minute or two difference based on when the subs were actually called in), I would simply note that change. After each game, I’d log the minutes in a spreadsheet.

Here are my players’ minutes by position for the season:

As you can see, I tried to get players time in as many positions as possible. P11 and P12 actually saw time at every single position while P3, P8, and P13 saw action at all but one. P9 only saw action in defense, but that was because of preference. I had a team of 14 players where at least 11 believed they were attackers. If a kid is willing and able to play defense and never wants to play offense, I’m going to oblige.

## The benefits

When it was all said and done, there were quite a few benefits to this system.

1. **I went into each game knowing which positions the players would work on that day.** While one of my goals was to win each game, I didn’t want to win at the cost of player development. This system ended up being a good way to make sure I didn’t do that. The only times I ever deviated from my match plan was when a player was forced to come off temporarily because of injury.
2. **The players knew what to expect.** Before games, some of my players would ask where they were playing that day. But they knew that once a match plan was set, it was non-negotiable. At practices, I was happy to discuss where they would like to play in upcoming matches. As the season went on everyone became more comfortable with the system—even the players who weren’t asking me where they were playing each game.
3. **I avoided pigeonholing.** I definitely had players who tended to be part of the attack much more often and had players who tended to defend. But I did my best to make sure those players still spent some time at other positions—particularly in practices and scrimmages. Did I do this perfectly? Certainly not. P10 didn’t play enough positions (I planned to use him in different places, but he ended up missing a couple games down the stretch), P6 (my son) was in defensive midfield way too much in the first half of the season, P2 probably should have spent more time as a midfielder, and so on. Tracking the player usage at least put these potential issues on my radar.
4. **I had the data.** There were a couple times when parents or players would come to me with a concern. In most cases, I had data to show them that things weren’t happening quite the way they thought it was. But I still took note of their concerns and made sure they didn’t become an issue in the future, either. One example is a fun one—I overheard P2 complaining to last year’s coach that “Coach Adam doesn’t even play me at striker this year.” I responded with “I’ve played you at striker 112 minutes this year!” which elicited a chuckle from both player and coach.
5. **Everyone played.** Remember that goal I had about every player playing at least half the time? I also tracked the percentage of possible minutes each player was on the field. Everybody played between 63% and 78% of the time. I’m proud of a couple things here—the fact that everyone played significantly more than half the time and that I didn’t lean on any players to play over 80% of the time.

Is this system for everyone? Maybe not. But it works for my risk-averse and analytical brain. I know I’ll continue to employ a variation of it in upcoming seasons.
