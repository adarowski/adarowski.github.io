Each year (see [2015](25-favorite-albums-of-2015) and [2016](25-favorite-albums-of-2016)), I usually start this post by saying how deep the year was in music. I feel like I can’t really call 2017 “deep” (this list of full-lengths goes only 20-deep rather than 25) but it was still a year that gave us some great records. For me, many of the great records came from unexpected sources.

The top record came from a known quantity, as **Iron Chic**’s first record for SideOneDummy was everything I hoped it would be. We had to wait a long time between 2013’s best record, *The Constant One*, and this year’s *You Can’t Stay Here* but it was absolutely worth it.

The rest of the Top 5 was rounded out by (mostly female-fronted) bands I wasn’t really familiar with before 2017. I was vaguely familiar with **Aye Nako**, but on *Silver Haze* they added a band member (Jade Payne) and fine-tuned their sound to resembe the direction that I hoped Speedy Ortiz would take after *Major Arcana*. **Great Grandpa** and **Charly Bliss** were completely new to me, but both records were in constant rotation all year. *Plastic Cough* is another that sounds like something I hoped would come from Speedy Ortiz while *Guppy* reminds me of Letters to Cleo or Tancred. Lastly, **Daddy Issues**’ maturity in the last two years on *Deep Dream* was impressive. I found myself going back to that record over and over.

Don’t forget that I also put out a single this year—[“Find the Way” b/w “Half Step”](find-the-way-half-step). Check it out if you haven’t!

Without further adieu, my favorite records of the year…
